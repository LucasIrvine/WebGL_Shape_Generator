WebGL_Shape_Generator
=====================

WebGL Shape generator, playing with fog and camera settings. A shape comes out of the fog as the camera pans in, camera pans back out making the shaoe return to fog and the shape changes each time it re-emerges. So I guess I can add screen saver to my list of accomplishments. ;)
